 The web calculator performs all the operations that the physical calculator does. It additionaly includes handling of edge cases which can reduce hassle of user and also help them to arrive at correct results as early as possible.
 
 Various Edges cases have been handled such as:
 
 * If multiple '.' are  typed by mistake then it preserves the previous number as well as   alerts the user about the mistake.
 * If the equation contains operator at last without the last operand, then the system alerts out the user. Eg. 2+ and equal to operator will alert the user.
 * If operators consecutively occuring then it alerts for it. Eg. 2+* will result in 2* and user will be alerted about the mistake.
